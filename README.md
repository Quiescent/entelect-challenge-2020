# Quantum -- Q's Submission to the 2020 Entelect Challenge

## Building
Run `make`.

## Running
The build script produces an executable in the current directory
called bot which is run with:

```
./bot
```

## Strategy
TBD.

## Environment requirements
Install [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html) common lisp
compiler and make sure it's on your path.

Install [QuickLisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/#installation) and
add quicklisp to your SBCL init file (by running
`(ql:add-to-init-file)` after loading quicklisp.lisp in SBCL).
